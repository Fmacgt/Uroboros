Uroboros
========

A minimal game made in Unity. Class project for CS9223 Minimalist Game Design.
This 2D game is closely tied with music and is a game which lasts for a maximum of 5 minutes(if you are amazing at it). 
From player testing we have found it to be very addictive and are planning to add depth to the game in terms of:
1) Visual Appeal (Eye-Candy)
2) Game Play Variations
3) Levels
